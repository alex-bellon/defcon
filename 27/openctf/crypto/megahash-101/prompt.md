I don't know why anyone worries about broken hash algorithms when there are just -so many- of them out there! If you just stack them all together, the flaws in each individual algorithm cover each other. It's basic Defense-in-Depth, and yet the entire cryptographic community never considered it! Introducing the MegaHash cryptographically secure hash algorithm. Basically, I stack together all the available algorithms in a vanilla Python 3.6 instance together in a sequence (a la BlockChain technology). Itâ€™s 100% unbreakable unless every single one of them is broken! For your first futile opportunity to get points, implement the easiest of the cryptographic attacks, a collision attack! -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack
